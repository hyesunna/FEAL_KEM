Alternatively, the source files can be downloaded through github menu 'Download ZIP'.

## Compile
### Prerequisites
Predrequisites to compile FEAL_KEM are as follows:
+ MPI
### Complie and build
+ Build FEAL_KEM
+ Build an example problem after guild FEAL_KEM
+ Build all
### Mores on compile option

## Running the example

# Folder structure
+ `src` : source files of FEAL_KEM 1.0
+ `example` : source files on example problem for 3D wave equation
+ `include` : header files are created after building
+ `lib` : static libraries of FEAL_KEM 1.0 are created after building
+ `doc` : documentation
+ `run` : an executable binary file for the example problem is created after building
+ `tool` : contains useful scripts and tools
